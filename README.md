# MemoAI 🎙️🧠  
**AI-Powered Voice Note-Taking Assistant**  
A concept demo built with FastAPI, Whisper, LangChain, and Streamlit.

**Real-Life Use Case**
🏃‍♀️ You're walking down the street, rushing to your next meeting.
A friend tells you about a movie you have to watch.
Or maybe your doctor texts you a time for your next appointment.
But your hands are full. Your mind is already busy.
🎙 Just speak. Say it out loud.
"Doctor appointment next Thursday at 10."
"Watch The Tetris Movie."
💡 MemoAI listens, transcribes, and automatically knows what to do:
– Adds the appointment to your calendar
– Sorts the movie into your "To Watch" list
– Reminds you at the right time
✅ No typing. No remembering.
Just voice + intelligence.


> 🚧 This is a portfolio project and not currently available as a production-ready app.  
> It demonstrates advanced use of voice-to-text, LLM-based categorization, and contextual AI prompts.
